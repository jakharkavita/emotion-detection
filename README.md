<h1>About</h1>
    The project involves detecting emotions from facial images and playing corresponding songs based on the detected emotions. The main steps in the project are
    <h3>Data Collection:</h3> Collecting a dataset of facial images categorized by different emotions.
    <h3>Data Preprocessing:</h3> Preparing the data for training by resizing images and normalizing pixel values.
    <h3> Model Training:</h3> Training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the emotions.
    <h3>Emotion Detection:</h3> Using the trained model to predict emotions from live video feed.
    <h3>Audio Playback:</h3>Playing a personalized message and a corresponding song based on the detected emotion.
<h1>Libraries</h1> 

    NumPy:For numerical operations.
    
    Pygame :For playing audio files.
    
    gTTS :For text-to-speech conversion.
    
    Pandas :For data manipulation and analysis.
    
    Matplotlib and Seaborn :For data visualization
    
    Scikit-learn :For splitting the dataset and evaluation.
    
    OpenCV :For image processing and capturing video feed.
    
    TensorFlow and Keras :For building and training the neural network.
